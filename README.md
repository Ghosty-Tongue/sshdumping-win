# sshflash-win

Forked from sshflash.

A version of sshflash to be packaged and released for use with Windows.

Focussed on relative accessibilty/reliabilty for Windows users, with the ultimate aim being the ability to flash a supported Leapfrog device in a single operation without the additional installation of dependancies or implementation of workarounds.
