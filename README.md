# sshflash-win

Forked from sshflash.

A version of sshflash to be packaged and released for use with Windows.

Focussed on relative accessibilty/reliabilty for Windows users, with the ultimate aim being the ability to flash a supported Leapfrog device in a single operation without the additional installation of dependancies or implementation of workarounds.  
  
To use, you will also need release files from Retroleap (mac2612 / retroleap).  Currently, this tool only supports Retroleap versions 2.0.0 upwards.

Please check the releases section and use the latest release, noting any workarounds or caveats currently in place!

Also, as this port is still in the very early stages of development, please use at your own risk!
