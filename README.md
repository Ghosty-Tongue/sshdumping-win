# sshflash-win

Forked from sshflash.

A version of sshflash to be packaged and released for use with Windows.

Focussed on relative accessibilty/reliabilty for Windows users, with the ultimate aim being the ability to flash a supported Leapfrog device in a single operation without the additional installation of dependancies or implementation of workarounds.  
  
To use, you will also need release files from Retroleap (mac2612 / retroleap).  Currently, this tool only supports Retroleap versions 2.0.0 upwards.  Retroleap files should be placed in the same directory as sshflash-win.  Once done, simply right-click sshflash-win.bat and 'Run as Administrator' to get started.

As this port is still in the very early stages of development, please use at your own risk!
