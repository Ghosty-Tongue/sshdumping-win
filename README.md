# sshflash-win

Forked from sshflash.

A version of sshflash to be packaged and released for use with Windows.

Focussed on relative accessibilty/reliabilty for Windows users, with the ultimate aim being the ability to flash a supported Leapfrog device in a single operation without the additional installation of dependancies or implementation of workarounds.  

As of 22/07/2021 this is currently a WIP - the main outstanding task ahead of a first alpha release is to complete the sshflash-win.bat file (a Windows Batch port of remote_flash.sh).
